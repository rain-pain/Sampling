# Sampling
This script solves a bivariate sample *(Probability theory)*.


## How to start:
You need to upload a text file with pairs of numbers using console.

You need to wait a bit and a folder will appear in the directory with the script, which contains a designed .docx file with all the pictures (pictures are also saved in the folder) 

As an example, a text file *example.txt* saved in this repository and final folder *"example"* too. All you have to do is run the script and type in the console *filename.txt*. In this case, this is the file *example.txt*.
